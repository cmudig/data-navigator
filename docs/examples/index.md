# Examples

Interactive examples showing Data Navigator in action with different chart types and navigation patterns.

## Basic

- [Simple List Navigation](/examples/simple-list) — A linear linked-list structure on a Bokeh stacked bar chart, navigated with left/right arrow keys.
- [Using the Inspector](/examples/using-the-inspector) — A bar chart with the Data Navigator Inspector showing the structure graph alongside the chart.
- [Inspecting Two Trees](/examples/inspecting-two-trees) — Two inspector modes (force and tree) side-by-side, both synced to a single bar chart.
- [Understanding Dimensions](/examples/understanding-dimensions) — Mini-examples showing how the dimensions API works: categorical, numerical, circular extents, and compressSparseDivisions.
- [Dimensions API Example](/examples/dimensions-api) — A line chart demonstrating how the dimensions API automatically builds hierarchical navigation from flat data.
- [Stacked Bar Chart](/examples/stacked-bar) — A multi-dimensional hierarchical structure on a Visa stacked bar chart, with category and date dimensions.

## Planned

::: info Coming Soon
More examples are being added, including tree navigation, D3 and Vega-Lite integrations, spatial navigation for scatterplots and maps, and experimental input modalities.
