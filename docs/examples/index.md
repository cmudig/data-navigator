# Examples

Interactive examples showing Data Navigator in action with different chart types and navigation patterns.

## Basic

- [Simple List Navigation](/examples/simple-list) — A linear linked-list structure on a Bokeh stacked bar chart, navigated with left/right arrow keys.
- [Using the Inspector](/examples/using-the-inspector) — A bar chart with the Data Navigator Inspector showing the structure graph alongside the chart.
- [Inspecting Force/Tree](/examples/inspecting-force-tree) — Two inspector modes (force and tree) side-by-side, both synced to a single bar chart.
- [Inspector Console Menu](/examples/inspector-console-menu) — An example of using the console and menu that enable in-depth inspection of Data Navigator's structure.
- [Understanding Dimensions](/examples/understanding-dimensions) — Mini-examples showing how the dimensions API works: categorical, numerical, circular extents, and compressSparseDivisions.
- [Dimensions API Example](/examples/dimensions-api) — A line chart demonstrating how the dimensions API automatically builds hierarchical navigation from flat data.
- [Stacked Bar Chart](/examples/stacked-bar) — A multi-dimensional hierarchical structure on a Visa stacked bar chart, with category and date dimensions.
- [Data Text Adventure](/examples/data-text-adventure) — A text adventure-style interface for navigating data structures without keyboard focus, designed for mobile and screen reader users.
- [LLM Text Adventure](/examples/llm-text-adventure) — Extends the text adventure with an optional AI assistant powered by Claude, enabling natural-language questions about the data.

## Planned

::: info Coming Soon
More examples are being added, D3 and Vega-Lite integrations, spatial navigation for maps, and experimental input modalities.
